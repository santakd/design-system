## About Pills

To create a pill, apply the `.slds-pill` class on a `<span>`.

Depending on your context, you will either need a linked pill or a pill option inside of a listbox.

For linked pills, a modifier class of `slds-pill_link` needs to be added to the existing `<span>` with the class name of `slds-pill`. You need an `<a>` inside of the span with the `slds-pill_link` class. The `<a>` will get the class name of `slds-pill__action`. This will treat the interactions differently from an unlinked pill option inside of a listbox.

For both linked pills and unlinked pill options, a `<span>` with the class name of `slds-pill__label` should contain the string of text describing the pill object.

Note, that a linked pill should not be used as a pill option inside of a listbox.

Additionally, a pill can have an icon or image that sits to the left-hand side of the `.slds-pill__label`. That icon or image should receive the class `.slds-pill__icon_container`.

You may also want the functionality to remove the pill as a selection. An "X" icon is normally used and will sit to the right-hand side of the `.slds-pill__label`. That icon should receive the class `.slds-pill__remove`.

A `.slds-pill_container` can be used as a visual container for multiple pill(s).

## Listbox Of Pill Options

<CodeView>{PillsExamplesListbox.default}</CodeView>

A Listbox of Pills is a way to display a list of selected options when performing user input, usually from a multi-select [Combobox](/components/combobox), [Lookup](/components/lookups) or [Picklist](/components/picklist).

### Accessibility

**Interaction requirements**

- Only 1 focused Pill per set of Pills
- The remove button must not be a focusable element, but can be clickable
- Delete with a keyboard is performed with the `Backspace` or `Delete` key when focused on a pill

**Notable attributes**

- `role="listbox"` is placed on the `ul`
- `aria-label` is applied to `listbox` to describe what the list of options are to the user
- `aria-orientation="horizontal"` is applied to the `listbox` to describe the left to right direction of the pills
- `role="presentation"` is placed on the `li` elements
- `role="option"` is placed on the `slds-pill` elements
- `aria-selected="true"` is applied to all `option` elements, this is because they have all be selected
- `tabindex="0"` is applied to the `option` that is in focus last. By default it is placed on the first `option`

**Keyboard navigation**

- The first `option` in the list will be take user focus initially, when tabbed to
- `Right` arrow key will move focus to the next pill in the list
- `Left` arrow key will move focus to the previous pill in the list
- `Left` arrow key when on the first `option` should cycle user focus to the last `option`
- `Right` arrow key when on the last `option` should cycle user focus to the first `option`
- `Delete` or `Backspace` key when focused on an `option` should remove that `option`. Focus should then be placed on the nearest `option`
  - When on the last `option`, place user focus on the previous `option`
  - When on the first `option`, place user focus on the next `option`
  - When on the only `option`, place user focus on the `listbox` or any `input` element the `option` might be associated with
