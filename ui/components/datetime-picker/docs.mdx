## About datetime picker

### Implementation

The datetime is two [form elements](/components/form-element), each containing a label and text [input](/components/input), and a dropdown [menu](/components/menus), containing a grid-based calendar and filters. The date form element acts as a trigger for the dropdown.

<Blockquote type="warning">
  <p>
    Placement of inline form elements inside a data table cell is not supported. Instead, use a button to invoke a popover, which does support form elements.
  </p>
</Blockquote>

The datetime picker has the following markup requirements:

**Desktop**
- Add `.slds-is-open` to the element with `.slds-dropdown-trigger` to invoke the dropdown that contains the datepicker and the list of time options.
- On the timepicker, the `.slds-has-focus` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has focus.
- On the timepicker, the `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `.slds-listbox__option` element that has been selected.
- On the datepicker, the `.slds-is-selected` modifier class is required on the `td` element that has the selected day.
- On the datepicker, the `.slds-is-today` modifier class is required on the `td` element that is the current day.

**Mobile**
- When on mobile, we want to leverage the native datetime picker by changing the `input` type from `text` to `datetime-local`
- The `input type="datetime-local"` will create an input field allowing a date and time to be easily entered â€” this includes year, month, day, hours, and minutes.
- When switching `input type="text"` to `input type="datetime-local"` for mobile, we need to remove the ARIA attributes. The native rendering doesn't require these.
  - On the element with the class `slds-combobox`, please remove `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-haspopup`.
  - On the `input` that we just added `type="datetime-local"` to, please remove `aria-controls`, `aria-autocomplete`, and `role="textbox"`.
