## About Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are typically constructed with an `ol` because their order matters. You mark up breadcrumbs with classes from the horizontal list utility. When you add the `slds-breadcrumb` class, the separators are automatically generated.

### Accessibility

Place the breadcrumb in a `nav` element with `role="navigation"`. The `nav` element is also marked-up with `aria-label="Breadcrumbs"` to describe the type of navigation.

## Base

## Variations

### With Overflow

The overflow menu breadcrumbs variant is a composition of the overflow menu with actions example of the menus component and breadcrumbs component. To implement this, include the overflow menu as the first `<li>` in the breadcrumb component. In order to vertically align all of the breadcrumb items to the center, add the `slds-grid_vertical-align-center` class to the `<ol>`.
