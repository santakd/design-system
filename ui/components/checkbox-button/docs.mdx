## About Checkbox Button

The checkbox button is similar to a checkbox in that it presents a user with a
binary choice for an item. However, the only action a user can take is to
add (or remove) an entity. When a user clicks the checkbox button, the entity is
stored, similar to an ‘add to cart’ experience, until the user saves changes.

The checkbox button is useful for increasing clarity. Since the button only adds
or removes entities, the user knows the action they will prompt upon click.
The checkbox button also provides a clear visual affordance and a large target to take this action.

Use the add button if the component you’re building:

- Exists without other multi-select elements (i.e. checkboxes)
- Allows users to select multiple entities
- Semantically fits the add/remove model

## Structure and Implementation

The checkbox `<input>` is visually hidden with `.slds-assistive-text` and a faux checkbox is created using the [icon blueprint](/components/icons) which allows the display of an icon instead of the standard checkbox.

Click and tap events are captured by a `<label>` that encases the entire blueprint. The `for` attribute of your `<label>` must match the `id` attribute of your `<input>`.

The states of the checkbox button are styled with the following classes:

| Class                               | State    | Description                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.slds-checkbox-button_is-checked`  | checked  | The checked state when the checkbox button has been selected                      |
| `.slds-checkbox-button_is-disabled` | disabled | The disabled state when the checkbox button has been disabled                     |
| `.slds-checkbox-button_is-focused`  | focused  | The focused state when the checkbox button has focus; important for accessibility |

When implementing this blueprint, monitor the state of the checkbox `<input>` and apply the appropriate state class listed in the above chart based on the current state of the checkbox `<input>`.

It is possible to change the icon used within the checkbox button, see [Different Icons](#different-icon) for more details.

## Examples

### Different Icon

You may change the utility icon used by the checkbox button depending on the action you are communicating. Reference the [utility icon listing](/icons/#utility) for all available options.

This example is using the `recycle_bin_empty` utility icon as its base state and the `recycle_bin_full` utility icon as its checked state.

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(Base.examples, 'checkbox-button-icon-symbol')}
</CodeView>

<CodeView>
  {getDisplayElementById(Base.examples, 'checkbox-button-checked-icon-symbol')}
</CodeView>
